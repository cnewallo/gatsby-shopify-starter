                        To offer holistic, feel good, guilt free products to the mentally emancipated:) and those who strive to be....internationally. I do think that I have become an overall better human being during this class and
                        I have grown so much as a person in a way in which I am not only benefitting myself but also enriching the lives of others in a positive way.

                        <p class="text-b">I also found myself writing a lot of poetry, putting down on paper my experiences, thoughts and feelings throughout my journey in college and sharing it with my friends and family.
                        In that way I was able to voice my internal feeling and emotions in a way that is not threatening and effective in communicating.
                        I have used Marian Chaceâ€™s body action technique in order to release the tension in my body when I may feel very stressed out,
                        allowing me to feel more relaxed and my body to feel lighter in order to continue with my day in a more stress free head space.
